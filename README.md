AiChemist/AIDD Berlin School 
=====================================

Repository developed and presented during the AIDD Berlin school 2024.

We covered the following topics:

* python packaging
* unit testing
* documentation


The root of this repo can be used to prepare the base environment (install copier). The actual copier
template is under `copier_template`. An Example config which can be passed to `copier copy` is contained in the
'example_configs' folder.

This repository is not maintained. However, if you have feedback open an issue or provide a pull request.


Note that this is not a `clean` template since it contains some examples of modules, tests and docstrings that are not
needed in a real project.
